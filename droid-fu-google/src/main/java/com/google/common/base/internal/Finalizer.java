/**
 * Thread that finalizes referents. All references should implement
 * {@code com.google.common.base.FinalizableReference}.
 *
 * <p>While this class is public, we consider it to be *internal* and not part
 * of our published API. It is public so we can access it reflectively across
 * class loaders in secure environments.
 *
 * <p>This class can't depend on other Google Collections code. If we were
 * to load this class in the same class loader as the rest of
 * Google Collections, this thread would keep an indirect strong reference
 * to the class loader and prevent it from being garbage collected. This
 * poses a problem for environments where you want to throw away the class
 * loader. For example, dynamically reloading a web application or unloading
 * an OSGi bundle.
 *
 * <p>{@code com.google.common.base.FinalizableReferenceQueue} loads this class
 * in its own class loader. That way, this class doesn't prevent the main
 * class loader from getting garbage collected, and this class can detect when
 * the main class loader has been garbage collected and stop itself.
