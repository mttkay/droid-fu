/**
 * For other classes like {@link concurrent.BetterAsyncTask} to work, you need
 * to have a class inheriting from DroidFuApplication. The DroidFuApplication
 * keeps a hash of WeakReferences mapping contexts (activites and services) to
 * their active instances, and when a {@link concurrent.BetterAsyncTask}
 * finishes, it will ask your application for the active instance. Hence the
 * need for subclassing and implementing this in your program.
 *
 * <h2>Resources</h2>
 *
 * Sometimes Droid-fu might want to show a dialog to the user. In these
 * situations it will look for a specific set of default resource strings. If
 * you don't define them, it will most likely crash trying to show them. The
 * strings are:
 * <ul>
 * <li>droidfu_dialog_button_send_error_report: used by
 * {@link activities.BetterActivity#newErrorHandlerDialog(Exception)}.
 * <li>droidfu_error_dialog_title: used by
 * {@link activities.BetterActivity#newErrorHandlerDialog(Exception)}.
 * <li>droidfu_error_report_email_address: used by
 * {@link activities.BetterActivity#newErrorHandlerDialog(Exception)}.
 * <li>droidfu_error_report_email_subject: used by
 * {@link activities.BetterActivity#newErrorHandlerDialog(Exception)}.
 * <li>droidfu_progress_dialog_message: used by {@link
 * concurrent.BetterAsyncTask}.
 * <li>droidfu_progress_dialog_title used by
 * {@link concurrent.BetterAsyncTask}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Caches</h2>
 *
 * Droid-fu enables two kinds of caches, one for http requests, and one for
 * memory/disk images. The first has to be enabled through {@link
 * http.BetterHttp#enableResponseCache(int initialCapacity, long
 * expirationInMinutes, int maxConcurrentThreads)}. The memory/disk cache for
 * images is automatically used for {@link widgets.WebImageView} objects, but
 * to make the disk cache effective you need to add to your manifest
 * permissions the attribute {@link
 * android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} or you won't be able to
 * save it to disk.
 * <p>
 * Both types of cache have automatic expiration limits, but you can force a
 * purge with {@link cachefu.HttpResponseCache#clear()} and {@link
 * imageloader.ImageLoader#clearCache()}.
